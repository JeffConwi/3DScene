1. How do I approach designing software?
New design skills crafted during the project

Developed proficiency in scene composition, balancing realism and demonstration of technical skills
Enhanced ability to modularize code for improved organization and maintainability
Learned to design flexible and reusable components (e.g., SetTransformations() method)

Design process followed

Started with object selection, choosing items that create a cohesive desk scene
Planned the code structure, separating different aspects of scene setup into distinct methods
Iteratively refined the design, adding features like multiple light sources and custom materials

Application of design tactics in future work

The modular approach can be applied to future projects, making code more manageable and scalable
The balance between realism and technical demonstration can guide future design decisions
The flexible object transformation method can be adapted for various 3D rendering projects

2. How do I approach developing programs?
New development strategies used in the 3D scene

Implemented abstraction through the ShapeMeshes class for drawing different shapes
Utilized separate methods for scene setup, improving code organization
Developed a flexible transformation method for easy object manipulation

Role of iteration in development

Iteratively added and refined scene elements (objects, lighting, materials)
Gradually improved code structure, moving from basic functionality to more organized, modular code
Continuously tested and adjusted scene composition and lighting for optimal visual results

Evolution of code development approach

Started with basic object rendering, then progressively added complexity
Moved towards more modular and reusable code as the project progressed
Incorporated more advanced features (multiple light sources, custom materials) in later stages

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Application of computational graphics knowledge in future education

Provides a strong foundation in 3D mathematics and spatial reasoning
Enhances problem-solving skills through complex system design
Offers experience in optimizing performance, crucial for advanced CS courses

Application of visualization skills in future professional work

Valuable for roles in game development, CAD design, or scientific visualization
Demonstrates ability to create user interfaces and interactive systems
Shows proficiency in translating conceptual ideas into visual representations

Technical Implementation Details
Object Selection

Chose desk items (lamp, books, mug, decorative item) for a relatable composition
Utilized various shapes to demonstrate proficiency with OpenGL primitives

Programming Approach

Created separate methods for scene setup (e.g., LoadSceneTextures(), DefineObjectMaterials())
Implemented a flexible SetTransformations() method for object positioning
Used the ShapeMeshes class to abstract complex drawing operations

Lighting and Materials

Implemented multiple light sources with varying colors and intensities
Defined custom materials (gold, cement, wood) for realistic object appearances

Texturing

Applied textures using SetShaderTexture() for easy texture swapping
Used SetTextureUVScale() for fine-tuning texture repetition

3D Scene Navigation Controls

Implemented WASD keys for camera movement
Added mouse control for camera orientation
Included view switching between perspective and orthographic projections

This reflection demonstrates the learning journey throughout the project, highlighting the development of both technical skills and problem-solving approaches in computer graphics.
